# **Rude Dude Burger Annihilator**

---

## **Description**

The Rude Dude is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once a burger has been eaten (annihilated), the burger can be moved from the "haven't been annihilated" section to the "have been annihilated" section by clicking the "eat burger" button. This application uses an ORM to connect to the MySql database, and Handlebars to populate the html templates for the end user.
